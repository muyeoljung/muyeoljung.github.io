			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<img src="/images/About_me_image.jpg", width="150">
			<p style="font-size:24px"> Hello! Thanks for visiting my page. </p>
			<p> I am Muyeol Jung from South Korea and PhD student at the Department of Geography, Durham University where I am looking at the impact of the construction of the barrages along rivers on water quality and diatom assemblages. Regarding this, more information can be found in the Research Tab.</p>
			<p> I achieved Bachelor's degree on Geography and Master's degree on Physical Geography at <a href="https://geog.knu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Geography department in Kyungpook National University</a> before I moved abroad to pursue a PhD degree in Durham. Between Master and PhD courses, I was involved with different types of research projects funded by the government-affiliated institutions. </p>
			<p> If you have any enquiry or question, feel free to contact me via whichever is most convenient to you </p>
