			<p> Hello! Thanks for visiting my page. </p>
			<p style="font-size:20px"> I am Muyeol Jung from South Korea and PhD student in Department of Geography, Durham University where I am looking at the impact of the construction of the weirs along rivers on Water Quality Data and Diatom Data. Regarding this, more informations can be found in Research.</p>
			<p style="font-size:20px"> I achieved Bachelor's degree on Geography and Master's degree on Physical Geography at <a href="https://geog.knu.ac.kr/">Geography department in Kyungpook National University</a> before I moved abroad to pursue a PhD degree in Durham. Between Master and PhD courses, I was involved with different types of research projects funded by the government-affiliated institutions. </p>
