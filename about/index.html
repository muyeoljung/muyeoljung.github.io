			<p style="font-size:24px"> Hello! Thanks for visiting my page. </p>
			<p>My name is Muyeol Jung and I am from South Korea. I am a Physical Geographer with expertise on application of diatoms to deal with environmental problems such as water pollution and degradation in river ecosystems as well as environmental changes during the Holocene.
				I obtained my PhD degree in Physical Geography at Durham University where I investigated the impact of barrage construction on water quality and diatom assemblages in the Nakdong River, South Korea. More information on this can be found under the Projects section.</p>
			<br>
			<p> I achieved Bachelor's degree in Geography and Master's degree in Physical Geography at the Geography department in Kyungpook National University before I moved abroad to pursue a PhD degree in Durham. Between Master and PhD courses, I was involved with different types of research projects funded by the government-affiliated institutions. </p>
			
			<h4>Research interests</h4>
			<p>My research interest lies on areas between Physical Geography, Ecology, Biology, and Archaeology and seeks to how can geographical thoughts and approaches can be usefully employed in solving environmental issues we face in modern society.</p>
			
			<ul class="Research interests">
				<li>Links between hydrological, geomorphological and ecological processes</li>
				<li>Fluvial Geomorphology</li>
				<li>Changes in Landcover and Landscape</li>
				<li>Paleogeomorphology and environmental reconstruction during the Holocene</li>
				<li>Application of Diatom Analysis</li></ul>
