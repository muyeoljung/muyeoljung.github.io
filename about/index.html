			<p style="font-size:24px"> Hello! Thanks for visiting my page. </p>
			<p> I am Muyeol Jung from South Korea and PhD student at the Department of Geography, Durham University where I am looking at the impact of the construction of the barrages along rivers on water quality and diatom assemblages. Regarding this, more information can be found in the Research Tab.</p>
			<p> I achieved Bachelor's degree in Geography and Master's degree in Physical Geography at the Geography department in Kyungpook National University before I moved abroad to pursue a PhD degree in Durham. Between Master and PhD courses, I was involved with different types of research projects funded by the government-affiliated institutions. </p>
			
			<h4>Research interests</h4>
