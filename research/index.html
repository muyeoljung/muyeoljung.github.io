		<ul><li> The introduction of the project</li></ul>
		<p> One of the largest rivers in the Republic of Korea, the Nakdong River, has been a main source of water to more than 6 million residents in the southeast part of Korea. As a part of Four Rivers Restoration Project which was implemented for four years from 2009 to 2012, eight weirs have been constructed along the river and are controlling the flow of the river. However, despite the fact that the environmental impact would have been significant on the river, research has not been carried out yet about how the construction of the weirs have made impact on the irver and its ecosystem.
		<ul><li>The aim of the project</li></ul>
		The aim of the project is to investigate 
		<ul><li>Research questions</li></ul>
		1. How have the water quality changed over the period?<br>
		2. How have the diatom composition behaved over the period?<br>
