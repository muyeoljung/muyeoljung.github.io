		<ul><li> Introduction</li></ul>
		<p> One of the largest rivers in the Republic of Korea, the Nakdong River, has been a main source of water to more than 6 million residents in the southeast part of Korea. As a part of Four Rivers Restoration Project which was implemented for four years from 2009 to 2012, eight weirs have been constructed along the river and are controlling the flow of the river. However, despite the fact that the environmental impact would have been significant on the river, research has not been carried out yet about how the construction of the weirs have made impact on the irver and its ecosystem.
		<ul><li>The aim of the project</li></ul>
		<p> The aim of the project is to exmaine changes in the water quality data and diatom data in relation to the construction of the weirs along the river. </p>
		<ul><li>Research questions</li></ul>
		<p>
		1. How has water quality (WQ) changed through time?<br>
		2. How have diatom assemblages responed to changes in WQ through time?<br>
		3. Are diatom-based approaches useful in demonstrating changes in the datasets through time? <br>
		4. What are the relationships between WQ + diatom samples and WQ + secondary data?<br>
		5. Is diatom analysis reliable enough for water quality assesment?<br>
		6. What are the differences in the relationships obtained in Q4 and are there any speices and/or relationships that can be used to better assess the health of rivers?<br>
